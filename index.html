      <h3>A Social worker and Motivational Speaker</h3>
      <p class="pjust">To help the people, who are dovid of social rights as a citizen,is my social duty as my view. And
        who are
        distreesed,need mentally support to succeed, always be with him.Everybody has to remember that each fail is the
        first step to learn something.If you want to shine in life,at first you have to burn like the sun.You have to
        respect every religion.Respect your youngers and elders.Do what you love to do. But remember don't do any kind
        of work that harms any lives.Think who you are,why you are on the earth and what is your duty to your
        surrondings.That thoughts help you,undoubtedly,to be a good human being.. </p>
